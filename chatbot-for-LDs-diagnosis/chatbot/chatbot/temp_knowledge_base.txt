ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

Dyslexia is a diﬃculty in learning to decode (read aloud) and to spell.
DSM5 classiﬁes dyslexia as one form of neurodevelopmental disorder.
Neurodevelopmental disorders are heritable, life-long conditions
with early onset. For many years, research on dyslexia proceeded on
the basis that it was a speciﬁc learning diﬃculty – speciﬁc meaning
that the diﬃculty could not be explained in terms of obvious causes
such as sensory problems or general learning diﬃculties (low IQ).
However, the failure to ﬁnd qualitative diﬀerences in reading, and
phonological skills, between children with dyslexia and children with
more general learning problems led this kind of ‘discrepancy’ deﬁnition to fall from favour. The Rose Review stated that dyslexia can occur
across the IQ range and that poor decoding skills require the same
kinds of intervention irrespective of IQ. In this paper, we argue that
loosening the criteria for dyslexia has inﬂuenced common understanding of the condition and led to diagnostic confusion. In the
longer term, the use of the term may need to change. Implications
for research and practice are discussed.

Dyslexia; reading disorder;
reading diﬃculties; history;
deﬁnition

A central theme in the history of dyslexia is the tension between the speciﬁcity of the
disorder and its complex association with other forms of learning disability. Since its
earliest description over 100 years ago, through the case ﬁles of the Word Blindness
Centre (Whyte, this issue) and of Tim Miles (Evans, this issue) to more recent neuropsychological case studies (e.g. JM; Snowling & Hulme, 1989) is the notion that dyslexia
is speciﬁc – a particular problem with reading and spelling that is somehow unexpected and therefore requiring a diagnosis and an explanation, as well as specialist
intervention. At the same time, the history of dyslexia captures a sense of complexity
that there might be ‘several “species” of dyslexia’ and it reﬂects a ‘family of disabilities’.
These tensions play out in perennial discussions surrounding the deﬁnition of dyslexia,
whether there are diﬀerent ‘subtypes’ and questions about whether it even exists. In
this article, we argue that loosening the criteria for dyslexia means that a far wider
range of individuals now receive the label; furthermore, by understanding the cooccurrence of dyslexia with other disorders, we reach a better understanding of the
heterogeneity of its manifestations.

Dyslexia – the discrepancy deﬁnition
For many years, research on dyslexia proceeded on the basis that it was a speciﬁc learning
diﬃculty. The term ‘speciﬁc’ here referred to the fact that children with dyslexia have
diﬃculties in the domain of reading (and spelling) that are ‘out of line’ with expectation,
given age and IQ. Educational and clinical psychology practice was to look for
a discrepancy between expected and actual reading attainment in order to ‘diagnose’
dyslexia. However, the failure to ﬁnd qualitative diﬀerences in reading (and the phonological skills that underpin it) between children with dyslexia and children with more
general learning problems led this kind of ‘discrepancy’ deﬁnition to lose credibility. To
understand the implications of moving away from a discrepancy-based deﬁnition, we
begin by reviewing how such a deﬁnition was operationalised and the evidence against
its validity.
Originally conceived of as a measure of General Cognitive Ability or ‘g’, an individual’s
IQ is simply their score on an IQ test. The most widely used measures of IQ are the
Wechsler Scales which can be used to assess preschoolers, children and adults (e.g.
Wechsler, 1974). For present purposes, it is important to note that these scales separate
tests tapping verbal skills from tests tapping non-verbal or performance skills (though the
division is not clean). The verbal tests include measures of vocabulary, verbal concepts,
knowledge of the world and mental arithmetic. The performance tests primarily require
practical responses, such as putting blocks together to make a pattern, or pieces of
a puzzle to make an object; unlike the verbal tests, they are timed and hence tap speed
of processing. An individual who has taken an IQ test typically obtains a Verbal IQ,
Performance IQ and a Full-Scale IQ combining across both. Assuming no obvious neurological or sensory impairment and no lack of educational opportunity, children with
average or above average Full-Scale IQ who nevertheless show problems with reading
and spelling may be classiﬁed as dyslexic. This category corresponds to ‘Speciﬁc Dyslexia’,
as used in the context of the Word Blind Centre (Naidoo, 1972). Dropping the discrepancy
deﬁnition broadens this category.
One of the early critics of the discrepancy deﬁnition of dyslexia was Stanovich (1991).
There were two main tenets of Stanovich’s argument against this approach. First, learning
to read has a positive eﬀect on verbal skills and vocabulary. Children who are good at
reading read more and therefore have a greater opportunity to learn new information via
print than children who are poor at reading. The corollary of this is a ‘Matthew eﬀect’: the
verbal skills of children who read less fail to keep pace with their peers (Stanovich, 1986).
On this view, lower Verbal IQ (and, by extension, Full-scale IQ too) can be a consequence
of poor reading and therefore the use of an IQ-based ‘discrepancy’ formula to diﬀerentiate
diﬀerent groups of readers is ﬂawed. Second, Stanovich and Siegel (1994) showed that
irrespective of IQ, poor readers experience the same core phonological diﬃculties (problems in dealing with the speech sounds of words). Given that reading skills show
a continuous distribution in the population and that there are no clear qualitative or
quantitative diﬀerences in reading as a function of discrepancy, eﬀectively this means
using the term ‘dyslexia’ for any cases of poor reading. While defensible on statistical
grounds, to regard dyslexia ‘just’ as poor reading (and spelling) fails to capture the fact
that it has an early onset (in preschool) and is persistent over time.

In an attempt to reconcile these views, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the
American Psychiatric Association (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) uses the term
‘Speciﬁc Learning Disorder with impairment in reading’ to describe what others, and
lobbyists in particular, call dyslexia. The DSM5 deﬁnition notes that the term refers to
a pattern of learning diﬃculties characterised by problems with accurate or ﬂuent word
reading, poor decoding, and poor spelling ‘that must have persisted for at least 6 months,
despite the provision of interventions that target those diﬃculties’ (p. 66). It also notes
that a good indicator is ‘low academic achievement for age or average achievement that
is sustainable only by extraordinarily high levels of eﬀort or support’ (p. 69).
In summary, dropping the IQ-discrepancy deﬁnition of dyslexia has proven controversial for many, particularly for those who see ‘dyslexia’ as a special category of disorder and
reject the view that it is only a reﬂection of poor reading. We will argue here that it is
important is to have a better understanding of the dimensionality of reading disorders
and how they frequently occur with other diﬃculties.

Putting learning into the deﬁnition of dyslexia and the phonological deﬁcit
hypothesis
Although intellectual disability precludes a diagnosis of speciﬁc learning disorder, once
the practice of restricting the diagnosis of dyslexia to those principally with aboveaverage IQ is abandoned, the kinds of learning diﬃculties to which the label ‘dyslexia’
applies widen and now include children with a broader range of learning problems. Such
children have a range of problems with reading which are not best characterised as
aﬀecting only accuracy and ﬂuency. A more principled approach then is to ﬁrst consider
the demands of learning to read and then consider how speciﬁc aspects of learning are
aﬀected in diﬀerent ‘types’ of poor reader.
At the core of dyslexia is a diﬃculty in learning to decode and to spell. It is important
therefore that our understanding of dyslexia is cast within a framework of learning to read.
Reading development is a complex process (for a review see Castles et al., 2018). In simple
terms, learning to read starts with learning mappings between print and sound. In alphabetic
languages, the mappings are at a ﬁne-grain between phonemes (the smallest units of speech)
and graphemes (letter and letter groups), and in English there are many inconsistencies in the
mappings, making learning to read diﬃcult. As children grasp this alphabetic principle, they
can translate print into sound and from that access the meaning of familiar words. This
decoding process provides a mechanism for acquiring detailed orthographic knowledge
about how written language works. Over time, and with reading experience, reliance on
overt decoding declines as word recognition becomes increasingly eﬃcient and automatised,
allowing children to go from print to meaning rapidly and eﬀortlessly.
More formally, we can consider reading development within the context of the inﬂuential
‘triangle model’, a computational model devised by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989). The
triangle model comprises three sets of representations (phonological, orthographic and
semantic) that interact and connect together to constitute the word recognition system.
Well before learning to read, children have well-developed phonological knowledge
(of the sounds of words) that has connections with their semantic system (the meaning of
words). Faced with written words, children need to form mappings from orthography to
phonology and thus to meaning. Semantic knowledge can also support the development

504

M. J. SNOWLING ET AL.

of word reading, providing the means to adjust a partial decoding attempt (such as
reading school as ‘s-chule’) and bring it in line with a known word. Reading experience
allows orthographic representations to become structured and for the whole system to
embody the statistical regularities that exist between print and sound, and print and
meaning.
In dyslexia, children are slow to learn to decode words and become ﬂuent; they also
struggle to generalise, that is, to read novel words they have never seen before. It is well
established that in cognitive terms, dyslexia is caused by problems at the level of
phonological representation (e.g. Shankweiler et al., 1979; Snowling & Hulme, 1994).
This hypothesis has its roots in long-standing clinical observations, arguably starting
with Orton (1937) and continuing with Bannatyne (1974), who noted diﬃculties in
‘auditory sequencing, auditory discrimination, and associating auditory symbols with
sequences of visual symbols’. A considerable body of research has since detailed the
nature of ‘auditory’ problems in dyslexia, narrowing the deﬁcit to one aﬀecting the sound
(phonological) structure of speech (Griﬃths & Snowling, 2001; Vellutino et al., 2004):
problems with phonology lead to diﬃculty in learning mappings between orthography
and phonology and other diﬃculties which include problems learning new spoken words,
poor verbal short-term memory and problems with word retrieval and picture naming
(see Snowling, 2019 for review). Although learning to read has a reciprocal inﬂuence on
phonological skills (Morais & Kolinsky, 2005), there is good evidence that phonological
deﬁcits in dyslexia are present in the preschool years, long before reading instruction
begins (Snowling, Nash et al., 2019). Moreover, training phonological skills and letter
knowledge improves reading ability, strengthening the claim that phonological skills are
causally related to reading development (Hulme et al., 2012).
Nonetheless, despite the strength of the phonological deﬁcit hypothesis, it seems that
phonological diﬃculties are neither necessary nor suﬃcient to account for dyslexia
(Pennington, 2006). While poor phonology is the impairment most consistently associated with dyslexia, many children at family risk of dyslexia who do not succumb to
reading diﬃculties also have problems with phonological awareness (Snowling & MelbyLervåg, 2016) and many individuals with dyslexia have deﬁcits outside of the phonological domain (Saksida et al., 2016; White et al., 2006). According to the inﬂuential theory by
Pennington (2006), dyslexia is the outcome of multiple risks which accumulate towards
a threshold for what is usually termed ‘diagnosis’. What are these additional risks and how
can they be conceptualised?
To consider these questions, we can begin by looking within the reading system itself.
While learning to read depends initially on learning mappings between orthography and
phonology, other factors are also important. Semantic knowledge adds another source of
variation: children with low language show relative weaknesses in learning to read words,
especially evident for those words that are diﬃcult to decode (Nation & Snowling, 1998).
More generally, longitudinal studies show that preschool variations in oral language are
associated with word reading ability in 8–9 year-olds (Hulme et al., 2015). Other research
has focussed more directly on the learning mechanisms involved and asked whether the
reading diﬃculties seen in dyslexia are associated with diﬀerences in paired-associate
learning or statistical learning (see Nation & Mak, 2019 for a review). In addition, some
children have been shown to have particular diﬃculty with letter position coding, making
errors when dealing with words where precision is needed (e.g. pirates and parties; smile

OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION

505

and slime; Kohnen et al., 2012). Together these ﬁndings indicate that an individual child’s
score on a standardised test of word reading reﬂects multiple sources of variation (and
diﬃculty). As computational models make clear, dyslexia is characterised by heterogeneity and individual diﬀerences (Harm & Seidenberg, 1999; Perry et al., 2019). However, to
understand dyslexia fully we need to look beyond the details of the reading system itself
and ask how additional factors inﬂuence reading and its development.
In summary, some of the complexity associated with dyslexia arises because the
predominant proximal cause – a phonological deﬁcit – is often not the only deﬁcit that
is observed. Moreover, phonological skills are themselves dimensional and can aﬀect one
or more aspects of reading. In particular, if the phonological diﬃculties occur as
a ‘downstream’ eﬀect of earlier language problems then reading comprehension as well
as word decoding will be signiﬁcantly aﬀected.

Comorbidities of dyslexia
Comorbidity refers to the co-occurrence between two (or more) disorders in the same
individual. Comorbidity can be found between disorders within the same diagnostic
grouping, e.g. reading disorder and mathematics disorder (both learning disorders with
shared risk factors) as well as between disorders from diﬀerent diagnostic groupings, such
as between reading disorder and behavioural and emotional disorders (Angold et al.,
1999). Rates of comorbidity between reading disorder and other neurodevelopmental
disorders vary widely but, on average, about 40% of the children with a reading disorder/
dyslexia will have another disorder as well (Moll et al., 2020). Many children with dyslexia
have oral language problems extending well beyond the phonological domain. This was
recognised by the Invalid Child’s Aid Association in setting up the Word Blind Centre
(Whyte, this issue) and is highlighted by Maughan et al. (2020) drawing on data from the
Isle of Wight studies in the 1960s. An inevitable consequence of removing the discrepancy
deﬁnition is that more children with poor reading in the context of broader and more
serious language diﬃculties will be labelled ‘dyslexic’. Since reading for meaning draws on
language skills, it follows that many poor readers also have poor reading comprehension
skills. Thus, whereas in classic discrepancy-deﬁned dyslexia, reading comprehension is
only an issue insofar as poor decoding presents a bottleneck to the construction of
meaning, this is not the case for children with dyslexia who have co-occurring language
problems; these children have poor reading comprehension too (Bishop & Snowling,
2004).
Some children with dyslexia meet criteria for Developmental Language Disorder (DLD),
a disorder characterised by persistent diﬃculties in expressive and/or receptive language
(Bishop et al., 2017). While usually considered a communication disorder separate from
learning disorders, DLD is a major risk factor for dyslexia. Indeed, McArthur et al. (2000)
showed that among children with speciﬁc reading diﬃculties (dyslexia), some 40% had
signiﬁcant language impairments; on the other hand, children who enter school with DLD
are at high risk of literacy diﬃculties (Bishop & Adams, 1990). In short, the boundaries of
dyslexia are not clear-cut: it is not uncommon for children with dyslexia to have language
problems and some children also meet clinical criteria for DLD (Catts et al., 2005;
Snowling, Nash et al., 2019). These language problems are under-diagnosed but are likely
to aﬀect response to intervention (Adlof & Hogan, 2019).

506

M. J. SNOWLING ET AL.

DLD is not the only disorder that co-occurs with dyslexia. Dyslexia is also often
comorbid with attentional and motor coordination problems (Gooch et al., 2014;
Rochelle & Talcott, 2006). There is also an overlap between dyslexia and speech sound
disorder (Pennington & Bishop, 2009), socio-emotional and behavioural disorders (Carroll
et al., 2005) and internalising problems such as anxiety and depression (Francis et al.,
2019). None of these comorbidities should be viewed as ‘core’ features of dyslexia, but
they can complicate both its presentation and response to intervention (Rose, 2009).
Importantly for the present discussion, following relaxation of the discrepancy deﬁnition
and hence the IQ cut-oﬀ, the number of ‘symptoms’ co-occurring with dyslexia has
increased.
Another disorder that is frequently comorbid with dyslexia is mathematics disorder (or
dyscalculia). Like reading disorder, mathematics disorder is classiﬁed as a speciﬁc learning
disorder in DSM5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); it is comorbid with dyslexia in
between 30% and 70% of the cases (Landerl & Moll, 2010). Like reading, mathematics is
also a complex skill with multiple components. The overlap with dyslexia is high because
many aspects of mathematics depend on verbal skills, e.g. number knowledge, counting,
retrieval of number facts and verbal problem solving (Göbel & Snowling, 2010; Moll et al.,
2018). However, mathematics also involves non-verbal skills; these include the ability to
estimate numerosity and to compare diﬀering magnitudes (Malone et al., in press).
Further, numeracy problems have been associated with poor visual-spatial skills, poor
executive function and working memory deﬁcits; such deﬁcits are commonly features of
the kinds of non-verbal learning diﬃculty associated with lower Performance IQ (Gillberg
& Gillberg, 1989). We can think of IQ as a broad measure of many aspects of cognition
(including language, spatial, and attentional skills). Statistically, if we insist that only
children with average IQ can be diagnosed with dyslexia, this will make dyslexia appear
to be a speciﬁc disorder (because children with language or attentional problems will
tend on average to have lower than average IQs and so fail to be diagnosed as dyslexic).
In summary, we argue that cases of ‘speciﬁc dyslexia’ exist and they are most apparent
when a strict discrepancy deﬁnition (reading poorer than expected for a child’s age and IQ) is
adopted. However, when it is dropped, a wider range of diﬃculties are observed among
children with reading disorders. The clinical and educational reality is that for many children,
poor reading sits within a constellation of diﬃculties each of which represents a dimension. As
the history of dyslexia shows, these are far from newly recognised issues; they have dogged
dyslexia since it was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the 19th century (Kirby, this issue).

Dyslexia diagnosis and treatment
A growing concern among educators is the increasing incidence of dyslexia in school and
in higher education. Do the increasing rates of this learning disorder reﬂect increased
awareness of the condition or do they reﬂect over-diagnosis, particularly among those
with the ﬁnancial means to seek private educational assessment? This is the nub of an
argument that has surfaced in a variety of forms since the ﬁrst cases of reading disorder
were described (Kirby, 2019). One of the main criticisms of those who are concerned with
labelling dyslexia as a categorical impairment is that there are no clear cut-oﬀ criteria
behind the diagnosis (Elliott & Grigorenko, 2014). DSM5 (American Psychiatric Association,
2013) stipulates that the term should only be used if there is restricted progress in

OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION

507

learning (to read/spell) and no catch-up with peers despite extra help at home or school;
there should also be a low academic achievement. While precise criteria are avoided given
the dimensional nature of the disorder, the manual does suggest that achievement (e.g. in
literacy or numeracy skills) more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean (a standard
score of 78) assures the greatest diagnostic certainty; it also goes on to assert various
exclusionary criteria and continues to advocate the importance of clinical judgement.
Arguably, it is the issue of clinical judgement which lies behind the dyslexia debate –
and yet for all clinical conditions including infections and diseases, clinical judgement
needs to be exercised before treatment can be determined.1 We should also emphasise
that dimensional disorders are common in many other areas of medicine and psychology – there are no clear cut-oﬀs for diagnosing hypertension, obesity or depression; but
for each of these very real conditions there need to be clinical decisions made about when
an individual needs treatment. The same is true for dyslexia. To avoid the issue of clinical
judgement and poor reliability around diagnostic thresholds, some have advocated the
use of ‘response to intervention’ as an approach to diagnosis (Fletcher & Vaughn, 2009).
Such an approach undoubtedly makes sense – if a child responds to treatment positively
and can catch up with peers, then the label of ‘dyslexia’ is not appropriate because the
condition is not persistent. Such children might be regarded as ‘instructional causalities’ –
not having been taught properly in the ﬁrst place or having suﬀered a set-back, for
example, because of a poor command of the language in the case of migration. However,
implementation of the response-to-intervention approach has not borne the anticipated
fruit; children who fail to respond to well-founded intervention are just as likely to be
identiﬁed following a comprehensive assessment with objective standards for referral for
intervention as after their poor response to intervention – so why wait? Moreover, the
characteristics of ‘treatment resistors’ include the phonological deﬁcits that characterise
dyslexia (Al Otaiba et al., 2014; Vellutino et al., 2004).
So where does this leave the issue of diagnosis and more broadly the practice of labelling
a child or adult as having dyslexia? First, we propose that the term dyslexia should not be used
as a shorthand for ‘reading disorder’ but should be used to refer to a diﬃculty with decoding
and spelling ﬂuency which is evident from the early school years and persistent over time.
Second, it should aﬀect academic functioning, such that progress is less good in literacy-based
areas of the curriculum than that of peers in a similar setting. Third, if there are co-occurring
features, these should be labelled as such but should not be considered core to the ‘diagnosis’.
Finally, the diagnosis should be qualiﬁed as mild (fully compensated when appropriate
arrangements are in place), moderate or severe; we hypothesise that those with ‘severe’
diﬃculties are often those with a range of comorbid conditions.
In a similar vein, Miciak et al. (2014) criticised approaches that focus on a range of
features in order to ‘diagnose’ dyslexia. Rather, they suggest that assessments should
focus on the deﬁning symptoms of reading diﬃculties, the functional impairments and
co-occurring conditions. Such clarity is important if the causes of dyslexia are to be
properly understood and the concept is to be fully embraced in educational policy.
Another issue that has concerned those who do not support the use of the term ‘dyslexia’
is the fact that the types of intervention that are known to be helpful do not diﬀer from
the interventions that are useful for other poor readers. This is, however, a simplistic view.
Dyslexia does equate with poor decoding and word reading, and therefore to say it
requires similar treatment to poor reading is a tautology. The most robust evidence for

508

M. J. SNOWLING ET AL.

the eﬀectiveness of reading interventions comes from randomised trials (e.g. Connor
et al., 2013; Hulme & Melby-Lervåg, 2015; Melby-Lervåg & Lervåg, 2014). To date, the
evidence suggests that the most eﬀective interventions for children with dyslexia are
phonologically based, involving training in phoneme awareness and letter knowledge
combined with structured reading practice (McArthur et al., 2012). These interventions
tackle the decoding deﬁcit in dyslexia directly. However, there is a dearth of evidence for
the eﬃcacy of interventions to improve spelling and writing ﬂuency – future research
must address these important questions as a matter of urgency. There is also a need for
treatment plans to consider the comorbidities that are associated with dyslexia, particularly language problems, and to consider their impact on the developing reading system.
If these are not addressed, then response to intervention is likely to be poor.
In summary, elaborate comprehensive assessments are not required to identify a child
as in need of reading intervention. What needs to be recognised is that reading is
a dimension that is correlated with other skills and co-occurring diﬃculties (comorbidities) need separate management.

Conclusions: when is dyslexia a disability?
The term dyslexia can be properly used to describe children who experience problems
learning to read and write; often when a basic level of reading and spelling ability is
established, there are persisting problems with reading ﬂuency. Dyslexia is a dimensional
disorder, however, with no clear cut-oﬀ from poor reading. This does not mean it is not
a handicap. If diﬃculties in learning and in developing ﬂuency persist, then we would argue
the term should be used, not least to signal the need for intervention. In addition, it should be
recognised that assessment is needed to identify co-occurring problems; if present, these may
require separate management, but they do not deﬁne dyslexia. The need to intervene is clear:
children with poor reading are at elevated risk for a range of emotional and behavioural
diﬃculties. Moreover, longer-term follow-up studies make clear that problems with literacy
persist into adulthood, and are associated with lower levels of educational attainment, higher
rates of unskilled employment, and often periods of unemployment (e.g. Maughan et al., this
issue). At the same time, since some individuals with dyslexia can compensate for their
diﬃculties, dyslexia need only be disabling if the individual remains unable to cope with the
literacy demands of study or work even when appropriate arrangements are in place.
How dyslexia is recognised by the education system, and by society more generally,
has changed over its history, and continues to evolve. Here we have aimed to clarify some
of the consequences that have followed from dropping the IQ-discrepancy deﬁnition of
dyslexia. While questions remain, how reading develops and how best to teach it are now
well understood (Castles et al., 2018) and policy implications are clear (Seidenberg, 2017).
Despite best eﬀorts, some children will continue to ﬁnd reading diﬃcult. Optimal outcomes for these children require us to embrace the dimensional nature of dyslexia and its
associated complexities; to fail to do so is negligent and arguably morally indefensible.

Kate Nation is Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of St
John’s College, Oxford. Her research is concerned with with language processing, especially reading
development. She is interested in how children learn to read words and comprehend text, and more
generally, the relationship between spoken language and written language. Her research spans
both typical and atypical development. A key aim at present is to investigate the mechanisms
involved in the transition from novice to expert. She also studies language processing in adults,
addressing the issue of how skilled behaviour emerges via language learning experience. Kate has
contributed to building links between psychological research and educational policy and practice.
She has served on a number of Editorial Boards and her research has been recognised by awards
