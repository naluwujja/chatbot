# ChatBot OpenAI

## Overview

ChatBot OpenAI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist with the early detection and diagnosis of learning disabilities in children. It leverages OpenAI's language models, conversational AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning techniques to provide accurate and context-aware assessments. The chatbot aims to support mental health professionals by automating initial screenings and generating reports based on user interactions.

## Features

- Conversational AI using OpenAI's GPT
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and up-to-date responses
- Fine-tuned model trained on datasets related to learning disabilities
- Screening for conditions like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and more
- Automated report generation for mental health professionals
- Multi-platform support (web, mobile, etc.)
- Context-aware and dynamic conversation handling

## Methodology

The chatbot integrates multiple AI techniques to enhance its effectiveness:

1. **Conversational AI:** Enables natural interactions with children to assess signs of learning disabilities through structured dialogues.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Reduces AI hallucinations by retrieving relevant documents and studies on learning disabilities.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** The base model is trained on clinical datasets related to learning disabilities, ensuring specialized responses.
4. **Automated Reports:** The chatbot generates reports identifying potential red flags, which can be used by mental health professionals to aid in diagnosis.
5. **Privacy & Security:** Ensures data confidentiality through on-device processing and anonymized retrieval of relevant documents.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- OpenAI API Key
- npm or yarn package manager

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-openai.git
   cd chatbot-openai
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
4. Start the chatbot:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Run the bot and interact via the command line, web UI, or integrated chat platforms.
- The chatbot asks structured questions similar to standardized screening tests (e.g., Denver Developmental Screening Test, Ages and Stages Questionnaire).
- The collected responses are analyzed for signs of learning disabilities.
- A detailed report is generated for further evaluation by mental health professionals.
- Extend functionality by integrating additional APIs and external databases.

## Configuration

Modify `config.js` to:

- Adjust bot personality
- Set rate limits
- Customize predefined responses related to learning disabilities
